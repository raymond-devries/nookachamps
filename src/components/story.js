                In 1962 Ray and Alice DeVries moved to the beautiful Skagit
                Valley located in northwest Washington State, USA. They started
                their family dairy farm in the fertile Nookachamps basin. Fast
                forward 50 plus years, and Nookachamps farm is still a family
                farm now producing hazelnuts, corn, grass and milk. The cows
                fertilize the ground and the ground produces natural, healthy,
                nutritious crops. We firmly believe that taking care of people
                and the environment will allow us to farm for years to come!
